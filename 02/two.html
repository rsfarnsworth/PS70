                                    Watching the tutorial in class I realized given my inexperience with both CAD and laser
                                    cutters, this would take some getting used to. Instead of designing with feet, I initially
                                    made the below design. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="first_box.png" alt="easy box">

                                    <br>
                                    I didn't have time to print this in class, however. I then watched this tutorial and produced
                                    this, based on that.  
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="4_fingers0.jpg" alt="4-finger">
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="4_fingers1.jpg" alt="4-finger">
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The first iteration following the tutorial actually had 4 fingers instead of 3, as seen above.
                                    Also as we can see, this didn't work exceptionally. I didn't account for kerf, and I think this 
                                    missing factor was exaggerated by the extra number of fingers. I then reduced the number of 
                                    fingers and tried to add a small amount of kerf to the design so the fingers would fit better. 
                                    Also, an issue was the scoring wasn't deep enough, I tried to fix this with Bobby's help and 
                                    the first try was also unsuccessful as the scoring just cut through. Images are all shown below.

                                    <br>

                                    <br>

                                    <br>
                                    The scoring issue was solved by putting the scoring power from 4% to 13.5%. Then the 3 fingers 
                                    I think work better overall, but there is still a fitment issue. One side holds well and the 
                                    other again fails, I think this is due to kerf again. The bottom image above shows how the fingers
                                    meet. I plan to go into the lab early next week to make another iteration to fix this, or glue
                                    it down for now. Currently my box and the remnants of the first two iteration lay on the shelf. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I printed out a different version trying to again account for kerf and this box was, again, weird, 
                                    I think from the CAD model being messy. I had a new one, this time making absolutely sure
                                    everything was fully constrained. Bobby helped me with a lot of this and I learned a magic trick
                                    thanks to the internet: File -> View -> Show Text Commands -> Type (Sketch.ShowUnderConstrained).
                                    This highlights all points and lines that are not fully constrianed. Using this, I correctly 
                                    managed the kerf and was able to produce fingers that fit well together, but the figures weren't 
                                    enough to have friction and hold it together. I've figured out what happened with the CAD, how 
                                    to deal with kerf, and a lot about laser cutting, I'm going to hot glue the box and call it. Images
                                    of the box and fingers are below.

                                    For my fusion 360 tutorial I followed 
                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qGQ2utl2A" target=" _blank">this</a>. It was very helpful in learning
                                    a lot about the basic features of fusion 360, although there are still aspects of it I think 
                                    would be good to learn/practice. I will probably continue to watch tutorials as I go. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    But I made this "lego" block from that tutorial.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>

                                    This was fun and interesting. This mainly exposed me to the 3D tools in fusion as well as just giving 
                                    me more practice with the skills we already used in class.

                                    For this modeling I want to first model a pen I made in the Mather woodturning shop. 
                                    This was actually way more difficult than I thought. Way more. I probably spent 2 hours on 
                                    the pen alone. I learned a lot about making 3D objects, specifically rotationally symmetric 
                                    objects. The pen isn't perfect, but neither is the handmade version, and most of the dimentions
                                    and proportions are accurate, however certain angles I slightly guessed. I also guessed the opening 
                                    of the pen tip to be 2mm. I had a lot of trial and error trying to get the colors/texture on the 
                                    pen so it looked more like a pen. Something I'd like to include is the grooves towards the grip
                                    of the pen. I tried using hte emboss feature but this turned out to be very difficult and 
                                    wasn't working like I expected. I also need to add the pen clip. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="pen.jpg" alt="pen">
                                    <br>

                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    To then make an assembly, I decided to create a mug that resembles the mug I have at my desk in my room. 
                                    This is imaged below as well. Here I got most of the correct dimentions like the height, thicknesses, handle 
                                    thickness, ect, but the handle shape is slightly off as you can see. This taught me more about making 3D objects 
                                    and I learned a lot about the sweep function and making these sometimes strange curved shapes. Additionally, 
                                    the making of an assembly was actually way more difficult than I expected because of how simply I thought 
                                    a pen inside a mug would be. The assembly dynamics were very weird, but very cool to actually get down. 
                                    I have the pen connected to the mug by a ball joint so that it can rotate along the mug, at least theoretically. 
                                    The weird thing about that though is that the pen is in the middle of the mug, which is not what would happen 
                                    in real life. The first image below is one of the reference images for the mug I used.
