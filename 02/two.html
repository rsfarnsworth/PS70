                                    Work through a Fusion 360 tutorial and document what you produce.

                                    Select at least 2 household objects or components from the lab 
                                    (could be items you think you might include in your final project). 
                                    Measure them using calipers, and model them in Fusion 360 (or other program). 
                                    Create an assembly using these components, and document your work on your webpage 
                                    (by assembly we just mean a 3D model that contains multiple components, possibly connected 
                                    by joints).

                                    Watching the tutorial in class I realized given my inexperience with both CAD and laser
                                    cutters, this would take some getting used to. Instead of designing with feet, I initially
                                    made the below design. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="first_box.png" alt="easy box">
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I didn't have time to print this in class, however. I then watched this tutorial and produced
                                    this, based on that.  
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="4_fingers0.jpg" alt="4-finger">
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="4_fingers1.jpg" alt="4-finger">
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The first iteration following the tutorial actually had 4 fingers instead of 3, as seen above.
                                    Also as we can see, this didn't work exceptionally. I didn't account for kerf, and I think this 
                                    missing factor was exaggerated by the extra number of fingers. I then reduced the number of 
                                    fingers and tried to add a small amount of kerf to the design so the fingers would fit better. 
                                    Also, an issue was the scoring wasn't deep enough, I tried to fix this with Bobby's help and 
                                    the first try was also unsuccessful as the scoring just cut through. Images are all shown below. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="scoring.jpg" alt="scoring error">
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="3_finger.jpg" alt="3-finger">
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="3_finger1.jpg" alt="3-finger">
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="kerf.jpg" alt="kerf">
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The scoring issue was solved by putting the scoring power from 4% to 13.5%. Then the 3 fingers 
                                    I think work better overall, but there is still a fitment issue. One side holds well and the 
                                    other again fails, I think this is due to kerf again. The bottom image above shows how the fingers
                                    meet. I plan to go into the lab early next week to make another iteration to fix this, or glue
                                    it down for now. Currently my box and the remnants of the first two iteration lay on the shelf.

                                    For my fusion 360 tutorial I followed 
                                    <a href="https://rsfarnsworth.github.io/PS70//.html">this</a>. It was very helpful in learning
                                    a lot about the basic features of fusion 360, although there are still aspects of it I think 
                                    would be good to learn/practice. I will probably continue to watch tutorials as I go.

                                    But I made this "lego" block from that tutorial.
