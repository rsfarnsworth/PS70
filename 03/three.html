                                    Create a kinetic sculpture. Include circuitry to move your sculpture.
                                    Control the sculpture with a circuit on a breadboard that uses components
                                    in the lab (eg. resistors, potentiometer). Use a multimeter to measure 
                                    voltages in your circuit. Use Ohm's law to calculate current through 
                                    the circuit. Document your work and learning. Use the photo booth in the 
                                    lab to record a video of your sculpture and include at least one video/gif
                                    in your documentation.

                                    My first idea for this was to create a sculpture of a drumming figure, but I didn't know
                                    how to do this. I first drew a rectangle, neck, and circle for head in CAD, while trying 
                                    to figure out the exact mechanism I'd use to get the motor's motion into this up and down motion of a 
                                    drum stick. I used the kits in class to prototype this and found the components and cams 
                                    exercise to be really effective. After some discussion with Nathan, I realized I could turn the cams 
                                    sideways and have them sit behind the "body" of my sculpture. Then just have drumsticks poke through. 
                                    I also added eyes and a smile for some funny details. The CAD is below. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="CAD1.png" alt="drummer dude cad">
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The cad wasn't that difficult. I measured the kits in class useing calipers to get the same 
                                    measurements for the hole thickenss and distnace from each other, but I deleted obviously 
                                    unnecessary ones to preserve more strength in the cardboard, though I'm not sure that was 
                                    actually needed. Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture of immediately after I laser cut, but
                                    this was the result once one came was in.

                                    <img src="1cam.jpg" alt="1 cam front">
                                    <br>

                                    The first problem I ran into was finding the right combination of height of the cam, as well 
                                    as which holes I need to connect the came to on the stick and where to anchor the stick. 
                                    Through basically trial and error I realized that the top hole was too high and the second 
                                    highest hole was too low, so I ran a wire through the top to anchor the sticks and hold them 
                                    where they need to be, creating the right motion.

                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This seemed to work, as well as with a screw and bolt in the last hole on the stick to help
                                    weight it down when the cam falls. You'll also notive in the last two pictures there is a brace 
                                    that holds the two sides together. This worked, but I realized I needed something to hold the 
                                    motor. This was solved with the folloiwng "bracket". THough, I still used the one seen above 
                                    in the final version to help stabalize the motor.

                                    I then used heat shrink directly between the motor and screws in the cams to connect the two.
                                    I didn't know this when I attempted this, but apparently the heat shrink tubing gets much harder
                                    and stiffer when shrunk, which worked nice for me. The following two images show the setup. You
                                    might also notice, I added an extra bolt and screw to the back of the sticks. These just helped them 
                                    move more quickly with the motor. Also quick note, I did CAD and cut the sticks myself, but I seem 
                                    to not have saved that file unfortunately.

                                    The motor was very quick and a little hard on the guy, so I wanted to slow it down using what we learned 
                                    in lab and in class. I used a potentiometer and arduino using the set up and code below.
